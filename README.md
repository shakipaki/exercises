# 🧬 Laboratory of Omics Science — Exercises Repository 📊

Welcome to my Laboratory of Omics Science Exercises repository.
This space is dedicated to collecting and sharing the exercises, analyses, and reports I develop as part of the Laboratory of Omics Science course at the University of Pavia.

The aim of this repository is to:

📊 Document my learning progress in omics data analysis, from preprocessing to interpretation.

📊 Showcase the R scripts, Quarto reports, and pipelines used during the course.

📊 Share my work with classmates and the broader scientific community for feedback, discussion, and improvement.

If you have any suggestions, comments, or ideas for improving my analyses, I’d be truly happy to hear from you.
Your feedback will help me grow as a bioinformatician and make this repository more valuable for others learning omics data analysis.
